Design of the code

Who did what
--
Ruying did all the programming and for both Milestone 1 and 2.
Thais generated the UML diagrams for the application.

Instructions
--
The TransferToUMLApp reads the files that are referenced on the static String array named "classes".

<-- To try and make it easier, the app "ReadFilesFromAnalyze" prints on the console the string array representation of all files within the "analyze" package. This can be used to copy and paste the console result on the TransferToUMLApp "classes" array. To do so, first copy all java files that will be read to the "analyze" package and than run it. -->

After the static String array is set, set the name of the output file on line 26 of the "TransferToUMLApp" file than run it. The process is finished and the file now has the textual representation of the UML diagram.
